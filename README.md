## College Platform 
Our aim is to create a centralized platform that is multifunctional, user-friendly, and extremely entertaining for college students. Any educational institution may utilize this generic, open-source platform _(not individuals)_. For the time being, we are introducing results-based ranking, announcements, polls, classroom availability, class schedules and timetables, and **a community like to Reddit** where students may engage with one another. 

Here is the initial preview :
